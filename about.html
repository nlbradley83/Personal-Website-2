            Ever since childhood, I've been deeply fascinated by the inner workings of things. This curiosity caused me to disassemble watches and video games, eager to uncover the secrets behind their functioning. As an adult, I became a civil engineer and later a home inspector, where I honed my skills in understanding structural, mechanical, and electrical systems. My journey didn't stop there; it further expanded into the realms of web design, where creativity meets functionality. 

            <br>Now, I find myself immersed in the world of software engineering. This latest chapter of my journey is both challenging and exhilarating. It's a field that constantly evolves and requires a perpetual learner's mindset, which resonates deeply with my lifelong pursuit of knowledge and improvement. As I navigate the complexities and ever-changing landscapes of software engineering, I am eager to grow, adapt, and contribute to this dynamic industry. </br>
